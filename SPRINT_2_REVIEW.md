# SPRINT 2 REVIEW

## Backend Core Logic: Collection & PDF Ingestion ✅ COMPLETE

### System Enhancements
- **Python 3.11** (Dockerized with virtual environment)
- **FastAPI**: Extended with full CRUD for collections and PDF management
- **Pydantic v2**: Updated schemas with `model_config = {"from_attributes": True}`
- **PDF Storage**: Files saved to `/app/data/pdfs/{collection_id}/` (configurable via Docker volumes)
- **Text Extraction**: Integrated PyMuPDF for PDF text and metadata extraction
- **Initial Corpus Ingestion**: Production-ready system to scan, copy, and register PDFs from configurable directory
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging, validation, and error recovery

### API Endpoints Implemented
- **Collections:** *(Full CRUD with validation)*
  - `POST /api/v1/collections` (create with name & description)
  - `GET /api/v1/collections` (list with pagination)
  - `GET /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}` (retrieve)
  - `PUT /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}` (update name/description)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}` (delete, prevents if PDFs exist)
- **PDFs:** *(With file validation & error handling)*
  - `POST /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}/pdfs/upload` (upload with size/type validation)
  - `POST /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}/pdfs/url` (add by URL with format validation)
  - `GET /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}/pdfs` (list PDFs in collection)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/pdfs/{pdf_id}` (remove PDF)

### Database Schema (Key Tables)
- **Collection:** id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
- **PDFDocument:** id, filename, title, file_path, status, collection_id, created_at, updated_at
- **QueryHistory:** id, question_text, answer_text, sources_count, collection_id, timestamp
- **Answer:** id, query_id, text, context_used, sources
- **AnswerFeedback:** id, answer_id, rating, comment

### Key Features Delivered
- **Collection CRUD**: Complete service and API with description field support
- **PDF Ingestion**: Upload with file validation (type, size), download by URL with timeout/redirect handling
- **Text Extraction**: Robust PyMuPDF integration with page metadata and error handling
- **Initial Corpus**: Production-ready ingestion with file copying, duplicate checking, and comprehensive logging
- **Error Handling**: Structured logging, input validation, graceful failure recovery
- **Security Features**: File size limits (10MB upload, 100MB download), content-type validation, URL format checking
- **Docker Integration**: Named volumes for PDF storage and SQLite DB persistence (no permission issues)

### Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Complete coverage for all service logic (collections, PDF ingestion, text extraction)
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints tested with proper mocking
- **Schema Compatibility**: Updated all tests for Pydantic v2 and new field requirements
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validation of error cases, file upload failures, and edge cases
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage of Sprint 2 functionality; all tests pass with Python 3.11

### Code Quality Improvements Made
- **Pydantic v2 Migration**: Updated all schemas from `orm_mode = True` to `model_config = {"from_attributes": True}`
- **Field Completeness**: Added missing fields (description, file_path, timestamps) to schemas
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added comprehensive input validation for file uploads and URL downloads
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Structured logging with appropriate levels throughout the application
- **Error Recovery**: Partial download cleanup, proper exception handling, status updates
- **Type Safety**: Improved type hints and return type consistency across all modules

### Demo Checklist
- [x] Create/list/rename/delete collections via API (with description field support)
- [x] Upload PDF with validation (file type, size limits) to a collection
- [x] Add PDF by URL with validation (URL format, content-type checking)
- [x] List and delete PDFs from collections
- [x] Initial corpus PDFs properly copied and registered with metadata
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout
- [x] All tests pass (`pytest --cov`) with improved coverage
- [x] OpenAPI spec available at `/openapi.json` with updated schemas
- [x] PDF files and DB properly persisted in Docker named volumes (eliminates permission issues)
- [x] Production-ready code with security features and validation

### Sprint 2 Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL MET
1. **Collection Management Service & API**: ✅ Complete CRUD with error handling
2. **PDF Ingestion Service & Storage**: ✅ Robust file handling with validation
3. **PDF Processing - Text Extraction**: ✅ PyMuPDF integration with metadata
4. **PDF Management API Endpoints**: ✅ Upload/URL endpoints with security
5. **Initial Corpus Ingestion**: ✅ Production-ready implementation

### Ready for Sprint 3 Integration
The Sprint 2 implementation provides a solid foundation for RAG pipeline integration:
- **Clean API Interface**: Well-defined endpoints for collection and PDF management
- **Robust Storage**: Reliable file storage and database persistence
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and logging
- **Security**: Input validation and file safety measures
- **Extensibility**: Clean architecture ready for RAG component integration
