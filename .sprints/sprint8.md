# Sprint 8: Deployment Preparation, Final Review & Project Handoff ðŸš€

**Goal:** Finalize all deployment artifacts, prepare demonstration materials for the CEO, conduct a final system review, and prepare the project for handoff. Ensure the application is robust and easy to set up and run locally via Docker.

**Tasks for Developer & Coding Assistant (Copilot for script generation/documentation):**

1.  **Dockerization Finalization & Optimization:**
    * Review and optimize all `Dockerfile`s (backend and frontend) for image size and build speed (e.g., ensure effective use of layer caching, multi-stage builds, removing unnecessary build dependencies from final images, minimizing copied files).
    * Review and optimize `docker compose.yml`:
        * Ensure clarity in service definitions, port mappings, and volume definitions.
        * Use environment variables for all configurable settings that might change between environments (even if only local development for now, it's good practice). Consider a `.env` file for `docker compose`.
        * Set sensible default resource limits (CPU, memory) for services, especially the backend service running the LLM, to prevent it from consuming all system resources on less powerful machines. Document how users might adjust these.
        * Ensure named volumes are used correctly for all persistent data (SQLite DB, PDF files, Vector DB, LLM models if downloaded into a volume). Named volumes eliminate file permission issues.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Dockerfiles and `docker compose.yml` are optimized, well-commented, and use best practices for local deployment. The application builds and runs reliably using `docker compose`.

2.  **Build and Run Scripts:**
    * Create simple shell scripts (`.sh` for Linux/macOS) and batch scripts (`.bat` for Windows) in the `project_root/scripts/` directory to automate common tasks:
        * `build.sh`/`build.bat`: Runs `docker compose build`.
        * `start.sh`/`start.bat`: Runs `docker compose up -d`.
        * `stop.sh`/`stop.bat`: Runs `docker compose down`.
        * `logs.sh`/`logs.bat`: Runs `docker compose logs -f` (or allows specifying a service, e.g., `logs.sh backend`).
        * `reset_data.sh`/`reset_data.bat` (Optional but helpful): A script to stop containers and remove Docker volumes, allowing for a clean restart (with user confirmation).
    * Ensure these scripts are executable and work correctly on their respective platforms.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** User-friendly build and run scripts are created, tested, and functional for common operations on both Linux/macOS and Windows.

3.  **Scalability, Limitations, and Future Work Document (`docs/SCALABILITY_LIMITATIONS_FUTURE.md`):**
    * **Scalability (Conceptual):**
        * Discuss potential bottlenecks for scaling to more users (concurrent API requests, LLM inference queueing), larger individual PDF files (parsing time, memory), and a significantly larger number of collections/PDFs (vector DB size, indexing time, metadata DB performance).
        * Briefly suggest conceptual approaches for addressing these (e.g., API rate limiting, task queues for ingestion/indexing, more robust database solutions if scaling beyond SQLite, distributed vector DBs - though out of scope for local app).
    * **Limitations:**
        * Document known limitations of the current system:
            * OCR for scanned PDFs (if not implemented, state it's a limitation).
            * Handling of heavily encrypted or malformed PDFs.
            * Potential biases from the chosen LLM and embedding models.
            * Performance on very low-end hardware (refer to Hardware Adaptability Guide).
            * Lack of real-time collaborative features (if relevant to any imagined future use).
            * Maximum PDF file size effectively supported (if any practical limits observed).
    * **Future Work:**
        * Suggest potential future improvements or features:
            * OCR integration (e.g., Tesseract).
            * Support for other document types (e.g., .docx, .txt).
            * More sophisticated chunking strategies.
            * Fine-tuning embedding models or LLMs on specific domain data (advanced).
            * UI for evaluating/annotating answer quality beyond thumbs up/down.
            * User authentication and authorization if the app were to be hosted.
            * Automated re-indexing strategies (e.g., on file changes if a watch mechanism were added).
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The document discussing scalability, limitations, and future work is comprehensive and provides realistic insights.

4.  **Demonstration Materials Preparation:**
    * Prepare a set of example queries (and their expected high-quality outputs, including citations) that showcase the system's capabilities effectively.
    * Prepare a brief report or presentation slides (as per original Deliverable #4) summarizing:
        * The project's final design choices.
        * Key challenges encountered and how they were addressed (especially regarding hardware adaptability, TFD implementation, and local-only operation).
        * Achieved results and how they meet the initial objectives.
        * A quick overview of the system architecture.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Example queries and outputs are ready. The summary report/presentation is prepared.

5.  **Final System Test & Walkthrough Rehearsal:**
    * Perform a full system test on a clean environment (or a different machine if possible), strictly following the `docs/SETUP_INSTALLATION.md` guide and using the provided build/run scripts.
    * Test all major functionalities: collection management, PDF ingestion (upload & URL), Q&A with different collections, history, feedback, manual re-indexing.
    * Rehearse the final demonstration/walkthrough for the CEO to ensure it's smooth and covers all key aspects.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The entire application builds, installs, and runs correctly using the provided scripts and documentation on a clean setup. Final demo flow is rehearsed.

6.  **Knowledge Transfer Preparation:**
    * Ensure all source code is well-organized, commented, and all documentation is up-to-date and pushed to the Git repository.
    * Consolidate any final notes or critical information not explicitly in formal documentation that would be useful for someone else maintaining or extending the project.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** All project artifacts (code, documentation, scripts) are finalized, organized, and committed to the Git repository, ready for handoff.

**Deliverable for CEO (Sprint 8):** ðŸŽ‰

* The final, deployable application, delivered as:
    * Access to the Git repository containing all source code, Docker files, scripts, and comprehensive documentation.
* Easy-to-use build and run scripts (`scripts/` directory).
* All documentation finalized and accessible (primarily in the `docs/` directory and the main `README.md`).
* The "Scalability, Limitations, and Future Work" document.
* The summary report/presentation slides.
* A live, comprehensive demonstration of the entire system:
    * Starting from a clean state (no Docker containers/volumes).
    * Using the provided scripts to build and start the application.
    * Walking through all UI features: creating collections, adding various PDFs, selecting collections, asking context-specific questions, showing accurate answers with citations, demonstrating "I don't know" for out-of-scope questions, viewing history, giving feedback, and triggering a manual re-index.
    * Briefly showcasing the documentation and how to use it.
    * Highlighting adherence to key constraints (local operation, TFD demonstrated by running tests if requested, portability via Docker).
