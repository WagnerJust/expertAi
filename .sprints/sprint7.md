# Sprint 7: System Integration, Comprehensive Testing & Documentation ðŸ§ªðŸ“š

**Goal:** Ensure all parts of the system (frontend, backend, database, vector store, LLMs) work together seamlessly. Achieve comprehensive test coverage as per Test-Focused Development (TFD) principles. Write all user, developer, and system documentation.

**Tasks for Developer & Coding Assistant (Copilot for code-related documentation/test generation):**

1.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy & Implementation:**
    * Define key E2E test scenarios covering main user flows. Examples:
        * User creates a collection -> uploads 2 PDFs -> triggers re-index -> asks a question answerable from PDF1 -> receives correct answer & citation -> asks a question answerable by combining info from PDF1 & PDF2 -> receives correct answer -> asks an out-of-context question -> receives "I don't know" -> gives feedback on an answer -> views history.
        * User adds PDF by URL.
        * User deletes a PDF (if implemented) / deletes a collection.
    * Choose an E2E testing framework if not already decided (e.g., Cypress `npm install cypress --save-dev`, Playwright).
    * Implement these E2E tests. These tests will interact with the UI and, by extension, the backend API.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Key E2E test scenarios are implemented and pass consistently against a full Dockerized environment. The E2E testing strategy is documented.

2.  **Test Coverage Review & Enhancement (Backend & Frontend):**
    * Run test coverage tools (`pytest --cov` for backend, `npm test -- --coverage` or `yarn test --coverage` for frontend with Jest/Vitest).
    * Analyze coverage reports. Identify and write missing unit and integration tests to achieve high coverage for all critical components (services, API endpoints, RAG components, UI components, utility functions).
    * Specifically address test cases from Core Requirement 7:
        * Questions with answers clearly present in single/multiple documents.
        * Questions whose answers are *not* in the documents for the selected collection.
        * Ambiguous or poorly phrased questions (to test robustness of "I don't know" or how well context is used).
        * UI interactions for PDF and collection management (ensure these are robustly covered if not fully by E2E).
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Test coverage for both backend and frontend is significantly improved and meets predefined project goals (e.g., >80% for key modules). All types of test cases from requirements are addressed. Coverage reports are available.

3.  **Hardware Adaptability Documentation & Configuration Validation:**
    * Write the "Hardware Adaptability Guide" (`docs/HARDWARE_ADAPTABILITY.md`). This should detail:
        * Instructions on how to configure/select different embedding models (e.g., changing `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME` in `backend/app/core/config.py`).
        * Instructions on how to configure/select different local LLMs (e.g., changing `LLM_MODEL_PATH` and related parameters in `config.py`).
        * Recommended minimum and ideal hardware specifications (RAM, CPU, GPU VRAM if applicable) for different tiers of performance (e.g., "To run with `all-mpnet-base-v2` and a 7B Q4 GGUF LLM, we recommend X GB RAM, Y CPU, Z GB VRAM for GPU offloading").
        * Justification for default model choices (performance, resource footprint, adaptability).
    * Validate that changing models via `config.py` (for reasonably similar models, e.g., another SentenceTransformer or another GGUF LLM) works as expected within the system.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The Hardware Adaptability Guide is written, comprehensive, and accurate. System configuration for model selection is validated.

4.  **Comprehensive Documentation Writing (Store in `docs/` directory):**
    * **`docs/SETUP_INSTALLATION.md`:**
        * Cloning the Git repository.
        * Docker installation prerequisites.
        * How to build and run the application using `docker-compose`.
        * Poetry environment setup for backend development (`poetry install`).
        * Node.js/npm/yarn setup for frontend development (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
        * Initial corpus directory setup.
    * **`docs/USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:**
        * Detailed instructions for all UI features: Q&A, collection management, PDF addition (upload/URL), viewing history, providing feedback, triggering manual re-indexing. Include screenshots where helpful.
    * **`docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`:**
        * Overview of frontend (React), backend (FastAPI), data flow (user request -> UI -> API -> RAG pipeline -> LLM -> response).
        * Diagram of components and their interactions.
        * Choices made based on the proposed architecture (and any deviations with rationale).
        * Mention how FastAPI facilitates OpenAPI specification.
    * **`docs/API_CONTRACT.md`:** (Can largely point to the `openapi.json` file).
        * Explanation of where to find the `openapi.json` specification.
        * Brief overview of API authentication (if any, though not specified for this local app) and versioning.
    * **`docs/CORPUS_COLLECTION_MANAGEMENT.md`:**
        * How to configure and manage the initial PDF directory.
        * Detailed explanation of adding/managing collections and PDFs via the UI.
        * Details on the manual re-indexing process (triggered via UI), its impact, and when to use it.
        * Explanation of Docker volume management for PDFs, collection metadata (SQLite DB), vector DB, user feedback, and query history.
    * **`docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`:**
        * Overview of the TFD approach implemented.
        * Types of tests implemented (unit, integration, E2E).
        * How to run backend tests (`pytest`).
        * How to run frontend tests (`npm test` or `yarn test`).
        * How to run E2E tests.
        * Location of test coverage reports.
    * **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`:**
        * Common issues (e.g., Docker build failures, model download issues, performance problems on low-spec hardware, PDF parsing errors for specific files).
        * Potential solutions and diagnostic steps (e.g., checking Docker logs, ensuring sufficient disk space/RAM).
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** All specified documentation is written, complete, accurate, and well-organized in the `docs/` directory.

5.  **`README.md` Finalization:**
    * Ensure the main `README.md` is comprehensive. It should include:
        * Project overview and objective.
        * Quick start guide (linking to `docs/SETUP_INSTALLATION.md`).
        * Key features.
        * Link to detailed documentation (the `docs/` directory).
        * Brief mention of technology stack.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** `README.md` is finalized, providing a clear and welcoming entry point to the project.

6.  **Code Review and Refactoring:**
    * Perform a thorough review of all backend and frontend code for clarity, consistency, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
    * Refactor code where necessary to improve readability, reduce redundancy, or enhance performance.
    * Ensure adequate comments and docstrings are present, especially for complex logic or public APIs/components.
    * Verify that environment variables are used for all configurable paths and settings.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Code has been reviewed and refactored for quality. Code is well-commented and follows consistent style.

**Deliverable for CEO (Sprint 7):** âœ…

* A fully integrated application where all components (frontend, backend, DBs, LLM) work together seamlessly, demonstrated via E2E tests and manual walkthrough.

* A report on test coverage (backend and frontend), and a demonstration of running the E2E test suite with passing results.
* A walkthrough of the "Hardware Adaptability Guide" and how model configurations can be changed.
